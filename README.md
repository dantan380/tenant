Don't touch dist directory

I added a eslintrc.cjs file to try to keep everyone's style guide working cooperatively!

## Installation
- Navigate to backend directory and `npm install`
- If you havn't already install TypeScript with `npm install -g typescript`
  - To check if its not installed try `tsc -v`
- In backend, create a `.env` file with username and password I can give you
